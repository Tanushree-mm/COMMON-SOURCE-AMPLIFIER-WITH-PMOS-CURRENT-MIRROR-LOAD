1. Create a New Library
In Virtuoso: File → New → Library

Name: CS_Amp_Lab4

Attach Technology: gpdk180

2. Create a New Cell View
In Library Manager: File → New → Cell View

Cell name: CS_Amplifier

Tool: Virtuoso Schematic Editor

View: schematic

3. Schematic Design
Instantiate transistors using gpdk180:

NMOS (M1): W = 6 µm, L = 180 nm

PMOS (M2, M3 - current mirror): W = 8.85 µm, L = 180 nm

Use:

VDD = 3.3V (from analogLib → vdc)

Vbias_P = 100 μA (from analogLib → isin)

Vin = small AC signal (from analogLib → vsin)

Capacitor = 500 fF

Resistor = 10 μΩ

GND (from analogLib)

4. Check and Save
Design → Check and Save

5. Create Symbol
Create → Cellview → From Cellview

Set pins: Vin, Vout, VDD, Vbias_P, GND

6. Create Testbench
Create new cell view: e.g., CS_Amplifier_tb

Instantiate the symbol created

Add:

VDD = 3.3V

Vbias_P = 100 μA

Vin = AC signal with:

AC magnitude: 1 V

Amplitude: 10 μV

Frequency: 10 kHz

Load capacitor: 500 fF

Resistor to GND if needed

Connect all appropriately

7. Launch ADE L
Launch → ADE L

8. Setup Simulation
Simulator: Spectre

Model Libraries: Add .scs file from gpdk180

Analyses:

Transient:

Stop time: 10 µs (or more as needed)

AC Analysis:

Sweep frequency (e.g., 1 Hz to 1 GHz)

9. Select Outputs
Outputs → Setup → From Design

Add Vin, Vout signals

10. Run Simulation
Simulation → Netlist and Run

11. Analyze Results
Use Tools → Calculator to:

Measure Gain = Vout / Vin

For UGB:

Results → Direct Plot → AC Magnitude & Phase

Place marker at 0 dB → Frequency = Unity Gain Bandwidth
