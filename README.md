# COMMON-SOURCE-AMPLIFIER-WITH-PMOS-CURRENT-MIRROR-LOAD

**OBJECTIVES**

(a) Capture the Schematic of a Common Source Amplifier with PMOS Current
Mirror Load and find its Transient Response and AC Response. Measure the
UGB and Amplification Factor by varying transistor geometries, study the
impact of variation in width to UGB.

(b) Draw the layout of Common Source Amplifier, use optimum layout methods.
Verify DRC and LVS, extract the parasitics and perform the post layout
simulation, compare the results with pre layout simulations. Record the
observations.
